This is a landing page for an art class organized by the celebrity artist.


Instead of a picture beside the text section in the hero section, I want the image removed and I want the text to be centerly aligned on the web view so that when the user lands on the page it is right in their front so that it is aligned with other sections. While on the mobile view it stays as it currently but with the "Start you journey now" button centerly aligned. Also, i want the hero section to move up a bit so that it is perfectly placed instead of tilting to the bottom. Secondly, all the call to action are supposed to be the same shape and have the same effect for coherence. they should look nice, follow the brand theme and also draw attention of the user. thirdly, the distance between all the sections are too much, even within some sections. Fourthly, make the fast action bonus section much more coherent and aesthetically looking, it doesn't look nice at all -also all the elements within it should look like they are together using the principle of proximity and similar design. Fifth, when I click every other call to action, they should point to the call to action in the fast action bonus section. Six, the before and after section should look much more before likewise the guarantee section. Seven, the delay effect whereby the sections ease in should be significantly reduced. Lastly, I want the website to be mobile responsive :



Let me analyze the requirements from the user and break them down into specific changes needed:

Add a placeholder payment link for the button in the fast action bonus section with id=fast-action.
Reduce text size in several sections: introduction, "the truth is" section, "it's no secret" section.
Make both images of Jacob smaller.
Format the before and after section items as lists:
Before section: use red X icons
After section: use green tick icons
Add "days", "hours", "minutes", and "seconds" labels beneath the numbers in the countdown section.
Fix footer content touching the edges in mobile view.
Reduce transition delays across the website.
Make YouTube containers have normal square borders in mobile view.









I want to leave a placeholder payment link for when the users click on the button in the fast action bonus section with id=fast-action. Secondly, some texts appear to be way bigger than the rest. For example, those in the introduction section section, the truth is section, it's no secret section, etc, Also both images of jacob should be a bit smaller. Also, in the before and after section, the items there should be listed in a list format. The before should perhaps use a green tick to reflect positivity while the list items of the before should be a red X icon. Also, add days, hours , minutes and seconds underneath the numbers in the countdown section- they shouldn't be too big but well placed. lastly, in the mobile view, the contents of the footer section are touching the edges of the iphone. also, reduce the transition delays in the website. also in mobile view, i want the youtube containers to have a normal border so that it is square:
Let me go through each of these changes step by step:

For the fast action button, I need to add a placeholder payment link. I'll likely need to modify the click event for the button with id=fast-action or the buttons inside that section.

For reducing text sizes, I'll need to adjust the typography classes in several sections.

For Jacob's images, I need to modify the size/dimensions.

For the before/after section, I need to modify the HTML to use proper list formatting with appropriate icons.

For the countdown timer, I need to add labels under each number.

For the footer mobile spacing issue, I need to add appropriate padding in the mobile media query.

For transition delays, I'll need to adjust transition times in the CSS.

For YouTube containers in mobile view, I need to modify their border-radius in mobile media queries.
